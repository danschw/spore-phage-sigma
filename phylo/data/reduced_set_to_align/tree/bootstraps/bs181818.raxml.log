RAxML-NG was called at 26-Aug-2021 06:54:47 as follows:

raxml-ng --bootstrap --msa /N/u/danschw/Carbonate/GitHub/spore-phage-sigma/phylo/data/reduced_set_to_align/check_msa/parse.raxml.rba --model LG+G4 --prefix bs181818 --seed 181818 --threads 2 --tree pars{5} --bs-trees 25

Analysis options:
  run mode: Bootstrapping
  start tree(s): parsimony (5)
  bootstrap replicates: 25
  random seed: 181818
  tip-inner: OFF
  pattern compression: ON
  per-rate scalers: OFF
  site repeats: ON
  branch lengths: proportional (ML estimate, algorithm: NR-FAST)
  SIMD kernels: AVX2
  parallelization: PTHREADS (2 threads), thread pinning: OFF

WARNING: The model you specified on the command line (LG+G4) will be ignored 
         since the binary MSA file already contains a model definition.
         If you want to change the model, please re-run RAxML-NG 
         with the original PHYLIP/FASTA alignment and --redo option.
